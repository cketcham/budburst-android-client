UCLA CENS project to write an android app to interface with http://budburst.ucar.edu/ to allow people to easily take images and make observations.

I tried to make a model abstraction for the sqlite3 database since the database was so unruly to begin with. Here is an overview of how it works. I am not sure I succeeded in making something extremely useful but I hope I did.

First there are different databases which you can instantiate which act on different kinds of models.
	1. StaticDatabase - this database just holds data which it imports from and sql file which can be placed in the res/raw folder.
	2. WritableDatabase - this database is the same as a StaticDatabase however you have the ability to insert data using the function insertRow, you pass a model to this function.
	3. SyncableDatabase - this database allows syncing down and up using json encodings.

There are different kinds of models you can then use with these databases.
	1. The base class is Row. It includes the default column _id.
	2. RelationRow. this is a row which maps data from two tables (HasMany). If you name the database species_phenophase, it means species has many phenophases.
	3. Syncable row. this is the row which should be used for the syncable database. it includes a field which tells if it is synced with the server or not.

to make a new model you should extend the appropriate base model.  Any public fields will be saved to the database. you can also make functions which can be called on a model to get more information such as plant.species() will give me the SpeciesRow for the current plant.

If you have any suggestions on how to make this better, please let me know. thanks.
